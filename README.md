CS-320-11372-M01 Software Test, Automation

This repository showcases my work on software testing, automation, and quality assurance through key project components:

Project One: Contact Service Files (Java) 
Contact.java: Defines the Contact data model.
ContactService.java: Implements logic for CRUD operations on contacts.
ContactTest.java: Unit tests for Contact.java functionality.
ContactServiceTest.java: Unit tests for ContactService.java methods.

Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report (separate file)
These projects demonstrate my ability to:
Write unit tests: ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java showcase how I use code to identify and isolate errors within software components.


Analyze testing approaches (Project Two):

The Summary and Reflections Report explores how different testing strategies can be applied based on requirements. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:
Identifying Requirements: Analyze project documents and user stories to understand the functionalities, performance needs, and security considerations.
Mapping Requirements to Testing Strategies: Based on the identified requirements, consider:
Unit Testing: Ideal for verifying individual components like the Contact classes in Project One.
Integration Testing: Ensures different modules work together seamlessly.

Functional Testing: Validates the software behaves as per user requirements and specifications.
Non-Functional Testing: Evaluates performance, usability, security, etc.
Regression Testing: Verifies existing functionality remains intact after code changes.

Tailoring the Test Plan: Select the most appropriate testing strategies based on the relative importance of each requirement and project constraints.
Apply testing strategies: Project One exemplifies tailoring testing approaches (unit testing) to meet project requirements.

Reflections on Software Development:
Ensuring Functionality and Security:
Implementing unit tests (like those in Project One) is crucial for catching errors early in development.
Secure coding practices (not covered in these projects) like input validation and proper data handling are essential for mitigating security risks.

Interpreting User Needs:
Project requirements serve as the foundation for understanding user needs.
Test scenarios should be designed to reflect how users will interact with the software.
Software Design Approach:

A well-defined software design promotes maintainability, scalability, and testability.

Project One demonstrates how clear separation of concerns (classes for data model, service logic, and tests) improves code organization and facilitates testing.
This portfolio provides a snapshot of my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. Feel free to explore the project files and the reflections report for a deeper understanding of my approach.
